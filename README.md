# Mutual NFT Searcher (Cross-chain Supported)

This project was created with [Covalent API](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#/0/0/USD/1), React, and Tailwind CSS for the [Klaytn-Covalent Unified Hackathon Bounty 1: NFT Track](https://gitcoin.co/issue/covalenthq/covalent-gitcoin-bounties/26/100028849).

The purpose of this project is to easily compare any two NFT projects in detail. Currently KLAY, ETH, MATIC, BSC is supported in this project. But using Covalent API, it can be expanded even more easily.

A simple whale counter is also implemented.

### Special Feature : 'Mutuals'

`Collectors are always on the move. Check if they own both projects.`

One special feature here is the 'mutuals' statistics. This project helps users to easily identify if there are any holders that own both bluechip NFT A and B.

- How many Sunmiya holders also have Metakongz?
- How many BAYC holders also have MAYC?
